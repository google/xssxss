This repository used to provide an `LD_PRELOAD` that helped
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) integrate with
[XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/). However, Chrome’s X interface
has changed, and it doesn’t work anymore. Use
[xscreensaver-dbus](https://github.com/google/xscreensaver-dbus) instead.
